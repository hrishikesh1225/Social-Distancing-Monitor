# Social-Distancing-Monitor

Small lot device that's alerts you when someone is too close and a transfer of the covid virus is possible. 

## Introduction 

### 1.Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to build a Smart IoT device which is capable of calculating your proximity to others in order to maintain social distancing in the current pandemic situation. This will help people in keeping up the distance and alert you if you get too close to others.

### 2.Scope 

The scope is this project and device is vast as the pandemic is a huge threat to humanity and this device can help individuals maintain the distance and help them beat the pandemic. This design is flexible and is adaptive to changes. Therefore, the capability and the scope of this device is copious.

### 3.Overview 

A Wearable Device made using NODE MCU, Adafruit NeoPixel Ring and Buzzer alert module. It is a Proximity/Distance Monitor which can be used to maintain proper social distance with the public during this COVID-19 outbreak. It will monitor your distance with others and will notify/alert you if social distancing is not maintained.

## Abstract

The coronavirus outbreak has shown the need to adapt, repurpose and innovate to save lives and to ensure that populations adjust to a new ‘socially distant’ reality. We know that in addition to everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread locally and across the country and world. Desperate Times Call for Desperate Measures, that is why we have come up with this simple Wearable device that notifies you to always maintain proper social-distancing in public and also which can tell you whether a person has properly sanitized his/her hands. This device can help you cruise through the ongoing pandemic and keep you safe and distanced from coming in contact with the deadly virus.
