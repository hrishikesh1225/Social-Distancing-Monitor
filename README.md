# Social-Distancing-Monitor

Small lot device that's alerts you when someone is too close and a transfer of the covid virus is possible. 

## Introduction 

### 1.Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to build a Smart IoT device which is capable of calculating your proximity to others in order to maintain social distancing in the current pandemic situation. This will help people in keeping up the distance and alert you if you get too close to others.

### 2.Scope 

The scope is this project and device is vast as the pandemic is a huge threat to humanity and this device can help individuals maintain the distance and help them beat the pandemic. This design is flexible and is adaptive to changes. Therefore, the capability and the scope of this device is copious.

### 3.Overview 

A Wearable Device made using NODE MCU, Adafruit NeoPixel Ring and Buzzer alert module. It is a Proximity/Distance Monitor which can be used to maintain proper social distance with the public during this COVID-19 outbreak. It will monitor your distance with others and will notify/alert you if social distancing is not maintained.

## Abstract

The coronavirus outbreak has shown the need to adapt, repurpose and innovate to save lives and to ensure that populations adjust to a new ‘socially distant’ reality. We know that in addition to everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread locally and across the country and world. Desperate Times Call for Desperate Measures, that is why we have come up with this simple Wearable device that notifies you to always maintain proper social-distancing in public and also which can tell you whether a person has properly sanitized his/her hands. This device can help you cruise through the ongoing pandemic and keep you safe and distanced from coming in contact with the deadly virus.

## Deliverables and Utility

### 1.Deliverables

Wearable device that notifies you to always maintain proper social-distancing in public and also which can tell you whether a person has properly sanitized his/her hands. This Wearable Device is made using NODE MCU, Adafruit NeoPixel Ring and Buzzer alert module. It is a Proximity/Distance Monitor which can be used to maintain proper social distance with the public during this COVID-19 outbreak. It will monitor your distance with others and will notify/alert you if social distancing is not maintained.

### 2.Utility

* The device can be used as a social distancing monitor in pandemic situations like COVID-19.
* The monitoring device notifies the user to maintain distance in order to break the chain and to prevent the spreading of the Coronavirus.
* The device can also be used as a sanity checker and a hygiene monitor in order to safeguard self from other people who have not sanitized their hands properly or are not wearing masks to stop the virus from spreading.

## Conclusion

Although much less fatal than the Ebola and previous SARS virus epidemics, the current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) has spread to more people (more than 125,000 in fewer than 50 days) in more countries (more than 120 countries) in a much shorter time frame (50 days). On March 11, 2020, the WHO has formally declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a scalable and automated solution that has seen explosive growth in other industries such as automated manufacturing, wearable consumer electronics, and asset management. Currently, IoT is already used to manage some aspects of the COVID-19. For example, drones are already used for public surveillance to ensure quarantine and the wearing of masks. AI has also been used to predict future outbreak areas.Public health personnel can monitor which patients remain quarantined, and which patients have breached the quarantine. The IoT data will also help them track down who else may be exposed due to the breach. Likewise, we have come up with this project in order to help people maintain social distancing and to break the chain. This device is a need of the hour and can really help the society a lot. The underlying technology and the IoT components that can be leveraged to enable a healthcare system to deal with disease outbreaks already exist; however, they are fragmented and not yet connected. Therefore, the system needs to be able to build up its infrastructure quickly to connect the components of data collection, processing, and storage, so that the system can scale and expand for disease tracking, preventive quarantine, and the in-patient care of the infected.
